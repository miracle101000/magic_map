### Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the `MagicMap` package in your project:

1. **Import the Package**:

   In your Dart file, import the `MagicMap` package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:magic_map/magic_map.dart';
   ```

2. **Create and Use `MagicMap`**:

   The `MagicMap` class allows you to access data in a map using dot notation.

   ```dart
   void main() {
     final data = MagicMap({
       'user': {
         'name': 'Alice',
         'age': 30,
         'address': {
           'city': 'New York',
           'zip': '10001',
         },
       },
     });

     print(data['user']['name']);  // Outputs: Alice
     print(data['user']['address']['city']);  // Outputs: New York
   }
   ```

### API Reference

- **MagicMap(Map<String, dynamic> data)**:  
  The constructor accepts a map and allows for dynamic access to nested keys using dot notation.

- **operator []**:  
  Allows accessing values within the map using the bracket syntax, e.g., `data['key']`.
